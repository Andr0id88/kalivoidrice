    Vim commands are divided into nouns, verbs and modifiers.
    Editing is performed by combining them.

And this is what gives vim the power. To ilustrate the point, here are some most used commands:

    Nouns: W - word, S - sentence, B- block, quotes and braces.
    Verbs: C - change, I - insert, V - visual, D - delete
    Modifiers: inside, around, till

And to ilustrate how you can mix them:

    Want to change a word? cw
    Same, but cursor in the middle of the word? caw
    Change text inside quotes? ci"
    change quotes? ca"
    Delete function body? di{
    Delete up till first comma? dt,
    Delete up till second comma? d2t,
    Jump to first comma? t,
    Select word? viw

Also notice how all commands nicely translate into natural language:

    Delete Word
    Change Inside {
